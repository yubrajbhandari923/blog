title: Tips for preparation of IOAA as a Nepali Student
description: ""
---
Okay there are great blog posts about preparing for IOAA out in web. I highly recommend to go through the posts linked below.

* [https://olymped.com/how-to-prepare-for-the-national-and-international-astronomy-olympiad/](<* https://olymped.com/how-to-prepare-for-the-national-and-international-astronomy-olympiad/>)
* <https://olymped.com/look-back-at-astro-olympiad-preparation/>

The resources they have mentioned is more than enough for a gold in IOAA if you follow through sincerely. 

Then, why a new post recommending same resources again? In this blog post I ll try to go through each books (the books I read), and highlight which chapters relavant for olympiad and which chapters to ignore. The main difficulty of preparing alone for IOAA was wasting time and energy in tough topics that I didn't need.
