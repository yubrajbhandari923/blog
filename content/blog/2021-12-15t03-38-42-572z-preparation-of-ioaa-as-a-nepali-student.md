title: Preparation of IOAA as a Nepali Student

Okay there are great blog posts about preparing for IOAA out in web. I highly recommend to go through the posts linked below.

* [https://olymped.com/how-to-prepare-for-the-national-and-international-astronomy-olympiad/](<* https://olymped.com/how-to-prepare-for-the-national-and-international-astronomy-olympiad/>)

The resources they have mentioned is more than enough for a gold in IOAA if you follow through sincerely. 

Then, why a new post recommending same resources again? In this blog post I ll try to go through each book (the books I read), and highlight which chapters relevant for Olympiad and which chapters to ignore. The main difficulty of preparing alone for IOAA, was wasting time and energy in tough topics that I didn't need. It's a skill learnt by experience. I will also mark out tips that might be useful.

 First things first, you MUST be fluent in high school physics. If you belong to grade 9 or 10, you must have a mentor(someone probably in grade 12) to guide you through basic physics topics. For grade 11 it's good to have someone who can teach you some topics in grade 12 physics, or else you can go through it yourself. For those who are in grade 12, I suggest not wait for your teacher to complete a chapter, if it is part of preparation go through it by yourself. 

There are mainly two types of books in Astronomy: Basics and Undergrad textbook. For me, basics are books like Universe by Roger Freedman or Astronomy by Openstax and Youtube lectures by [Michel van Biezen](https://www.youtube.com/c/MichelvanBiezen) or Professor Dave Explains . These books are really good for beginners. There is not much mathematics and you can understand them easily. These are the books I recommend to beginners. But these are very thick books and will consume lots of time so Youtube lecture might be better option. And Undergrad textbooks are well undergrad texbooks,
